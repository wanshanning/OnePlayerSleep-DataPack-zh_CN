# Minecraft 1.13 / 1.14 / 1.15 / 1.16 的单玩家睡觉数据包

这个单人睡眠数据包允许玩家跳过多人服务器上的夜晚

它有这些特性:
  - 可热更新。将其放入您存档文件的datapacks文件夹中，如果你已经开启作弊，请键入/reload以加载数据包。若无法开启作弊，你可以使用F3+T加载数据包
  - Weather Control. A common problem in multiplayer servers is that the weather goes crazy after skipping the night too many times, this Data Pack solves it.
  - Waking up system. Any player can wake up sleeping players to stop them from skiping the night, just click on the sleeping announcement.

Version 2.2 Features:
  - Random sleeping announcements. A series of messages displayed at random when someone sleeps.
  - Random wake up messages. A series of messages when a player is woken up by somebody.

Version 2.3 Features:
  - Weather changes to cycle the weather often.

Version 2.4 Features:
  - Better weather control.
  - Players now can stop storms if they go to sleep when is daytime.
  - Fix: Time would advance for a long time if it was storming in the morning and players were sleeping.
  Now storms end when the sun comes up and the player will naturally get woken up.
  - The weather will only be affected in case of thunderstorm during the day (and players taking action). This data pack does not change the weather with regular sleeping at night.

Version 2.5 Features:
  - Support for Minecraft 1.14 snapshots. Mojang removed the "Sleeping" NBT from their data model.
  - Added compatibility! Data pack will work in Minecraft 1.13 and 1.14
  - Fixed some messages to be gender neutral.
  - Commented gamerule sendCommandFeedback, this made some people crazy thinking I broke their Minecraft server.
  - Tested in Snapshot 19w09a and Minecraft 1.14 Pre-releases.
  - Changed the waking up feature to something more clever than silly snowballs thrown at players
  - Tested in Minecraft 1.13.2 Works as expected

Version 3.0 Features:
  - Version checking
  - Version control
  - Changes to setup/install/uninstall


Thank you for choosing my data pack! To better serve the community I've made it compatible with several versions of Minecraft and added some fool-proofing needed for servers with odd settings like having the weather cycle off. Many years of testing this pack in several servers and addressing all the problems has made this a really solid pack. This might be the last version ever needed.

Version 3.1 Features:
  - Removed Version control (it was confusing people and made them think the pack was not working)
  - Added checks for weather cycle (if it was off it would set the weather to storm permanently)
